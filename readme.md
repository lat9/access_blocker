# Access Blocker for Zen Cart v1.5.5 and Later

This drop-in plugin provides your store with admin-level controls to block (or limit) actions provided by the contact_us, create_account and login pages and/or limit access to the guest-checkout provided by [One-Page Checkout](https://vinosdefrutastropicales.com/index.php?main_page=product_info&cPath=2_7&products_id=69). If access is blocked via admin-level configuration:

1. **contact_us**. The message appears to be sent, but no email is actually generated.
1. **create_account**. An account appears to have been created, but it's not (and no emails are sent). The message (defined in the plugin's message-file) is displayed to give the illusion of an account having been created.
1. **login**. The login is denied, with the "standard" _Error: Sorry, there is no match for that email address and/or password._ message being displayed.
1. **guest-checkout**.  Guest checkout is disabled, so it is not offered as a choice on the `login` page.  Any active guest checkout on a blocked IP address reverts to the 3-page version.

Some features of the plugin require that you request a free API key from the [ipdata.co](https://ipdata.co) service. That service identifies "known" threats, based on a supplied IP address â€” Access Blocker makes that request based on the IP address used to access your site.
